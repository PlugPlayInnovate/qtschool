<p>We believe in catering and aesthetic ambience that would be required to fulfill the quench of global recognition , and thus the efficiency of The Packianath Public School (TPPS) has been sculpted upon three vital factors : Parents , Students and the school management. Our parents have been highly instrumental in our school&#39;s growth. The trust they have vested in our standards clearly indicate their positivity, support and a high-level of responsibility in taking the school process in the right perspective through their constructive feedback, involvement and encouragement. My heartfelt thanks to them all for their faith in us which we are committed to see efficaciously achieved.</p>
<p>Being a global citizen is the need of the hour, we nurture our students to be empathetic and skillful in knowledge. Academically our children are showing remarkable progress for the past three years. Our children have explored in all competitions and brought laurels to TPPS.</p>
<p>The management , under the guidance of our correspondent Mr.P.Sundarnath, is highly supportive to TPPS in progressing towards excellence. It is the collective vision of the TPPS management to foster global citizens.</p>
